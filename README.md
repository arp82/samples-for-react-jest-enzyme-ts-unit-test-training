# samples-for-react-jest-enzyme-ts-unit-test-training

This is a very simple project to be used as the basis of a short training course on testing for some colleagues. The samples here will be providing some basic examples of testing performed with Jest + Enzyme for React-Redux. The main focus is thus placed on providing some hands-on examples of matching, mocking, shallow-rendering, etc.
